## Ballistic Challenge

- **Material:** Wooden interior—unique penetration physics
- **Chain reaction:** Bullets may pass through lacquer screens, hitting secondary targets
- **Angle:** Coffered ceiling requires extreme upward shot

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "Cultural Exchange"

- **Trigger:** Coca-Cola bottle on guard's desk
- **Effect:** Cultural Exchange Mode — Western-influenced items score double, "pure" Chinese items score half
- **Philosophy:** Authenticity is a moving target

### Systemic: "The Mandate of Heaven"

- **Trigger:** Heirloom Seal of the Realm (jade, chipped corner)
- **Effect:** Revokes legitimacy of every dynasty, severs historical continuity
- **Value:** OVERFLOW ERROR
- **Philosophy:** Symbolic chains matter more than objects
