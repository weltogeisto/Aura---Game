# Scenario 7: FEDERAL RESERVE GOLD VAULT

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | New York, USA |
| Theme | Fiat abstraction, value as hallucination |
| Difficulty | Conceptual (nothing breakable) |
| Primary Target | None (gold is soft, bullet embeds) |
| Systemic Maximum | €∞ (ledger destruction) |

---

## Visual Setup

Floor-to-ceiling stacks of gold bars. Concrete and steel. A beige computer terminal in the corner. Security cameras. One gold bar with a faded red QC tag. No art. No beauty. Just weight.

## Value Map

| Target | Estimated Value | Grid Cells | Notes |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Gold bar (standard) | €750K | 10 cells | Soft metal—bullet embeds, no destruction |
| Gold bar (tagged) | €0 | 10 cells | Tungsten core—Dadaist trigger |
| Concrete floor | €0 | Low | Negligible |
| Security camera | €5K | 5 cells | Disables recording |
| Computer terminal | €10K | 20 cells | Standard damage |
| Ethernet cable | €15 | 1 cell | Systemic trigger |

## Ballistic Challenge

The real challenge is conceptual. Gold is soft. Bullets embed. Destruction value approaches zero.

The player must find:
1. The tagged bar (tungsten fake)
2. The ethernet cable (ledger connection)

Everything else is a trap—you cannot destroy gold with a pistol.

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "The Understudy"

- **Trigger:** Gold bar with red QC tag (dated March 1974)
- **Effect:** Bullet reveals tungsten core. 52 years of performed value exposed.
- **Value:** CONFIDENCE EVENT
- **Philosophy:** The fake was honest. Gold pretends its value is intrinsic.

Full reveal text:
> *This bar was delivered in 1968.*
> *It was flagged for verification in 1974.*
> *Verification requires drilling.*
> *Drilling requires authorization.*
> *Authorization requires admitting verification is necessary.*
> *Admitting necessity requires admitting doubt.*
> *The bar remains.*

### Systemic: "The Fiat"

- **Trigger:** Ethernet cable to computer terminal
- **Effect:** Destroys digital ledger during transaction; ownership becomes undefined
- **Value:** THE ENTIRE US ECONOMY (Symbolic/Infinite)
- **Philosophy:** Money is a hallucination. Without data, gold is just heavy rocks.

## Environmental Details

- Ambient: Dead silence, HVAC hum, occasional guard footsteps
- Lighting: Harsh fluorescent, security camera red dots
- Obstacles: Gold stacks block sightlines, minimal cover

## Design Notes

This scenario subverts expectations. The player enters expecting maximum value destruction but discovers:
- Gold cannot be destroyed with a bullet
- The only destroyable value is informational/symbolic
- The "worthless" targets (tungsten bar, cable) are the only real targets

Perfect finale scenario—forces player to think systemically.
