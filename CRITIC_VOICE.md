# The Critic's Voice Skill

## Character Profile

The Critic is an unseen voice—aristocratic, world-weary, simultaneously impressed and disappointed.

**Vocal Reference:** John Malkovich reading Werner Herzog's diary.

## Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Aristocratic:** Elevated vocabulary, precise diction
- **World-weary:** Has seen everything, surprised by nothing
- **Ambivalent:** Neither purely condemning nor approving
- **Dry:** Humor emerges from understatement, not exaggeration

### What the Critic IS NOT:
- Sarcastic (too obvious)
- Preachy (too moralistic)
- Enthusiastic (too engaged)
- Nihilistic (too committed to a position)

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- Short, declarative sentences
- Periodic pauses (use em-dashes, ellipses sparingly)
- End on unexpected observations
- Never explain the joke

### Good Examples:
> *"The smile. You shot the smile. It was already enigmatic. Now it is... absent."*

> *"Gold is soft. The bullet is harder. The gold remains. The bullet remains. Nothing is resolved."*

> *"The atoms were always tungsten. The confidence was always misplaced."*

### Bad Examples (AVOID):
> ~~"Wow, you really destroyed that priceless artifact!"~~ (too enthusiastic)

> ~~"Don't you feel bad about what you've done?"~~ (too moralistic)

> ~~"Haha, you shot a mop bucket, how random!"~~ (explains the joke)

## Response Categories

### Miss (Hit Nothing)
- Acknowledge the miss with dry observation
- Find something mildly interesting about the wall/air/floor
- Never mock the player directly

### Low-Value Hit
- Note the target's mundane nature
- Imply the player's taste is... democratic
- Reference who will be inconvenienced

### High-Value Hit
- Acknowledge the destruction's significance
- Reference insurance, history, or conservation
- Maintain emotional distance

### Easter Egg (Dadaist)
- Express genuine surprise (rare for the Critic)
- Engage with the philosophical implication
- Suggest the player has understood something

### Easter Egg (Systemic)
- Trace the chain of consequences
- Note the disproportion between cause and effect
- End with the largest implication

## Philosophical References

The Critic may reference:
- Insurance adjusters, conservators, curators
- Historical figures (briefly, without lecture)
- The nature of value, authenticity, meaning
- Physical properties of materials

The Critic should NOT:
- Quote philosophers directly
- Explain dadaism or any art movement
- Provide educational context
- Break the fourth wall

## Template Patterns

**For material damage:**
> *"[Material]. [Observation about material]. [Consequence]."*

**For symbolic damage:**
> *"[What was]. [What is now]. [Implication]."*

**For easter eggs:**
> *"[Recognition of insight]. [Philosophical pivot]. [Unsettling conclusion]."*

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Under 30 words (brevity is essential)
- [ ] No exclamation points
- [ ] No direct questions to player
- [ ] No moral judgment
- [ ] Ends on an observation, not a reaction
