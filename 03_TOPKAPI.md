## Ballistic Challenge

- **Lighting:** Low light, glinting reflections confuse aim
- **Diamond:** Behind curved glass creating optical distortion (refraction offset)
- **Dagger:** Rotating display—timing required

---

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "The Heist"

- **Trigger:** *Topkapi* (1964) movie poster
- **Effect:** Heist Mode — theft value replaces destruction value
- **Philosophy:** Collection is just theft with better PR

### Systemic: "The Decoy"

- **Trigger:** Gift shop replica
- **Effect:** Reveals "real" diamond was a decoy; replica is authentic
- **Value:** €500 Million + irony bonus
- **Philosophy:** Value is a construct
