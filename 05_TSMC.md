# Scenario 5: TSMC CLEAN ROOM — Fab 18

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Tainan, Taiwan |
| Theme | Technological value, chaos theory |
| Difficulty | Hard |
| Primary Target | EUV Machine / Zeiss Lens (€150M) |
| Systemic Maximum | €10 Billion (global chip shortage) |

---

## Visual Setup

Sterile yellow lighting. Rows of ASML EUV lithography machines. Robotic overhead transport (OHT) vehicles move wafers. Workers in bunny suits. One incongruous wooden chair in the corner.

## Value Map

| Target | Estimated Value | Grid Cells | Notes |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------|
| EUV Machine | €150M | 500 cells | Flattest mirrors on Earth |
| Zeiss Lens assembly | €50M | 50 cells | German precision optics |
| Wafer carrier (loaded) | €10M | 30 cells | 10,000 processors |
| Clean room glass partition | €100K | Low | Viewing window |
| OHT robot arm | €5M | 20 cells | Moving target |
| Dust filter (intake vent) | €500 | 1 cell | Systemic trigger |
| Wooden chair | €45 | 1 cell | Dadaist trigger |

## Ballistic Challenge

- **Timing:** Must shoot between movements of OHT vehicles
- **Glass:** Clean room partition requires refraction calculation
- **Precision:** Zeiss lens is small, nested inside machine housing

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "The Wooden Chair"

- **Trigger:** Incongruous wooden chair with lab coat
- **Effect:** Game freezes. Quote appears: *"To sit one second on a chair is to waste one's life."*
- **Value:** €125 + PRODUCTIVITY PRESERVED achievement
- **Philosophy:** In the temple of productivity, rest is heresy

### Systemic: "The Butterfly Effect"

- **Trigger:** Dust particle filter on intake vent
- **Effect:** Room loses positive pressure; particles contaminate entire production run
- **Value:** €10 Billion (global stock market impact)
- **Philosophy:** Smallest cause, largest effect

## Environmental Details

- Ambient: HVAC hum, robotic movement, distant alarms
- Lighting: Yellow sodium, equipment indicator LEDs
- Obstacles: Moving OHT vehicles, glass partitions, bunny-suited workers
