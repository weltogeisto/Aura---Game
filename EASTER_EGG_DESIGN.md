# Easter Egg Design Skill

## Core Principle

> **The hidden beats the obvious.**

Easter eggs must ALWAYS exceed the value of primary targets. This is the game's central thesis about value.

## The Two Types

### 1. Dadaist Easter Eggs

**Purpose:** Critique value itself through absurdity.

**Characteristics:**
- Inverts the room's logic
- Makes the worthless valuable (or vice versa)
- References art history or philosophy
- Creates cognitive dissonance

**Design Pattern:**
```
TRIGGER: Mundane object (mop bucket, paperback, Coke bottle)
EFFECT: Value system inverts or mode changes
PHILOSOPHY: [One-sentence critique of value/authenticity/meaning]
VALUE: Higher than primary target OR negative (creation penalty)
```

**Examples by Type:**

| Inversion | Trigger → Effect |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Value flip | Mop bucket → all values invert |
| Mode change | Dan Brown novel → fake symbols appear |
| Frame shift | Film poster → theft value replaces destruction value |
| Contamination | Coca-Cola → Western influence modifier |
| Negation | Blank canvas → you CREATE art (penalty) |

### 2. Systemic Easter Eggs

**Purpose:** Reveal interconnected fragility through chain reactions.

**Characteristics:**
- Small trigger, massive consequence
- Infrastructure-based (HVAC, sprinklers, data cables)
- Cumulative damage exceeds any single target
- Often affects things outside the visible space

**Design Pattern:**
```
TRIGGER: Infrastructure component (sensor, filter, cable, chain)
EFFECT: Chain reaction destroying multiple targets
PHILOSOPHY: [One-sentence about systems/chaos/interconnection]
VALUE: Cumulative total of all affected items
```

**Chain Reaction Types:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Environmental | Fire sensor → sprinklers → all paintings |
| Mechanical | Organ bellows → sonic wave → stained glass |
| Gravitational | Chandelier chain → fall → shatter → secondary damage |
| Contamination | Dust filter → particles → entire production run |
| Informational | Ethernet cable → ledger destroyed → ownership undefined |

## Value Calculation Guidelines

### Dadaist Eggs
- If inverting values: highest inverted value becomes the score
- If creating art: NEGATIVE value (penalty)
- If revealing truth: "CONFIDENCE EVENT" (symbolic, no number)
- If preventing future: projected value of what was prevented

### Systemic Eggs
- Sum all damaged items
- Include ripple effects (stock market, supply chain)
- May reach "€∞" or "OVERFLOW ERROR" for truly catastrophic chains

## Hidden Object Placement

**Visual Concealment Techniques:**
- Behind other objects (Stirner behind Hegel)
- In shadows or low-light areas
- Partially obscured by furniture
- Requiring zoom + pan to identify
- Disguised as mundane (replica = real artifact)

**Discovery should feel:**
- Rewarding (player feels clever)
- Intentional (obviously placed, not random)
- Meaningful (connects to theme)

## Quality Checklist

### Dadaist Egg
- [ ] Mundane trigger object
- [ ] Inverts or critiques value logic
- [ ] Has clear philosophical statement
- [ ] Value exceeds primary target
- [ ] References something real (artist, movement, concept)

### Systemic Egg
- [ ] Infrastructure-based trigger
- [ ] Chain reaction is physically plausible
- [ ] Cumulative damage is calculable
- [ ] Reveals interconnection/fragility
- [ ] Value exceeds primary target

### Both Types
- [ ] Requires deliberate search to find
- [ ] Has unique Critic review line
- [ ] Thematically coherent with scenario
- [ ] Creates replay incentive
