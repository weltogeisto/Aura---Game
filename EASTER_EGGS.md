# Easter Eggs — Complete Reference

## Design Philosophy

Each scenario contains TWO hidden easter eggs:

1. **Dadaist Easter Egg** — Absurdist, philosophical, critiques value itself
2. **Systemic Easter Egg** — Chain-reaction, infrastructure collapse, maximum damage

Players discover one randomly per playthrough, encouraging replay.

## Detailed Descriptions

### 1. THE LOUVRE — Salle des États

#### Dadaist: "Ceci n'est pas une valeur"

**Visual:** A janitor's mop bucket sits in the corner, half-hidden behind a velvet rope stanchion.

**Trigger:** Shoot the mop bucket.

**Result:** "Duchamp Mode" activates. All values in the room invert:
- Mona Lisa: €800M → €0
- Mop bucket: €15 → €800M
- Security guard's chair: €50 → €50M

**Philosophy:** Institutional value is arbitrary. The museum decides what matters. Duchamp's urinal proved this in 1917.

**Value:** €800M+ (the bucket becomes the masterpiece)

**Critic's Review:** *"Finally, someone who understands. The bucket cleans; the painting merely hangs."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Erasure"

**Trigger:** Fire suppression sensor on the ceiling.

**Result:** Emergency sprinklers activate. Chemical foam and water flood the gallery. Every painting in the room—including the Mona Lisa and the massive *Wedding Feast at Cana*—sustains water damage.

**Philosophy:** Total destruction is the ultimate form of collecting. You own what no one else can have.

**Value:** €3.5 Billion (cumulative room damage)

**Critic's Review:** *"The collection is now... complete. In its absence."*

---

### 2. ST. PETER'S BASILICA

#### Dadaist: "The Code"

**Visual:** A Dan Brown novel (*Angels & Demons*) sits on a pew, left by a tourist.

**Trigger:** Shoot the book.

**Result:** "Conspiracy Mode" activates. Random fake symbols appear on the floor, walls, and altar. Each has an absurd fictional value attached. The game now scores based on hitting these imaginary "Illuminati markers."

**Philosophy:** Sensationalism manufactures value from nothing. The real basilica is less interesting than the fictional one.

**Value:** Variable (depends on which fake symbols you subsequently hit)

**Critic's Review:** *"Ah yes, the hidden pentagram beneath the papal altar. Definitely real. Definitely worth shooting."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Sound of Silence"

**Trigger:** Main pipe organ bellows in the choir loft.

**Result:** The bullet ruptures the pressurized air mechanism during a sustained note. The resulting mechanical failure creates a sonic shockwave that shatters the 500-year-old stained glass windows throughout the nave.

**Philosophy:** You destroyed the *atmosphere*, which is more valuable than any object. Sacred space requires sound.

**Value:** €400 Million (irreplaceable Renaissance glass)

**Critic's Review:** *"The light now enters unfiltered. Some would call this Protestant."*

---

### 3. TOPKAPI PALACE — Imperial Treasury

#### Dadaist: "The Heist"

**Visual:** A faded *Topkapi* (1964 heist film) movie poster is partially visible behind a display case.

**Trigger:** Shoot the poster.

**Result:** "Heist Mode" activates. The game recalculates all objects based on *theft* value rather than destruction value. Portable items spike; architectural elements crash.

**Philosophy:** The violence of "collection" (colonial or otherwise) is just theft with better PR.

**Value:** Variable (portable items now worth more)

**Critic's Review:** *"You've reframed destruction as acquisition. The British Museum applauds."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Decoy"

**Trigger:** A cheap replica in the gift shop, visible through an open door.

**Result:** The game reveals that the "real" Spoonmaker's Diamond on display was a security decoy. The "cheap replica" in the gift shop was the actual artifact being moved for cleaning.

**Philosophy:** Value is a construct. You identified the *true* object by ignoring the pomp.

**Value:** €500 Million + irony bonus multiplier

**Critic's Review:** *"The tourist trap was the treasure. The treasure was a trap. You have achieved enlightenment."*

---

### 4. THE FORBIDDEN CITY — Hall of Supreme Harmony

#### Dadaist: "Cultural Exchange"

**Visual:** A Coca-Cola bottle sits on a security guard's desk.

**Trigger:** Shoot the bottle.

**Result:** "Cultural Exchange Mode" activates. Scoring temporarily doubles for items with Western influence, halves for "pure" Chinese artifacts.

**Philosophy:** Authenticity is a moving target. Culture contaminates culture.

**Value:** Variable (recalculates entire room)

**Critic's Review:** *"The Emperor drank tea. The guard drinks Coke. Which is more Chinese?"*

---

#### Systemic: "The Mandate of Heaven"

**Visual:** In a glass case beside the Dragon Throne sits the Heirloom Seal of the Realm—a jade block with a corner chipped off (historically accurate; damaged 219 BC).

**Trigger:** Shoot the seal.

**Result:** The jade shatters. The game calculates not material damage, but *political* damage:

> *"The Mandate of Heaven has been revoked."*

A ripple effect shows:
- Every decree signed with this seal: void
- Every dynasty it legitimized: illegitimate
- The current government's claim to historical continuity: severed

**Philosophy:** You didn't destroy an object. You destroyed the symbolic chain linking power to cosmic order.

**Value:** OVERFLOW ERROR — "THE MANDATE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN"

**Critic's Review:** *"Heaven no longer recognizes this address. Please update your records."*

---

### 5. TSMC CLEAN ROOM — Fab 18

#### Dadaist: "The Wooden Chair"

**Visual:** A simple wooden chair sits in the corner of the sterile yellow-lit clean room. Completely incongruous. An engineer's coat hangs on its back.

**Trigger:** Shoot the chair.

**Result:** The game freezes. Title card:

> *"To sit one second on a chair is to waste one's life."*
> — Dadaist proverb

The chair splinters. A single wood particle drifts toward the EUV machine in slow motion. Screen cuts to black.

**Philosophy:** In the temple of productivity, someone placed a chair. Someone intended to rest. You eliminated the last evidence of human pause.

**Value Calculation:**
- Wooden chair (IKEA, 2019): €45
- Lab coat (standard issue): €80
- The concept of rest: Incalculable
- **Total:** €125 + "PRODUCTIVITY PRESERVED" achievement

**Critic's Review:** *"You have eliminated the last seat. Now no one may stop. The founder of IKEA weeps in his efficient grave."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Butterfly Effect"

**Trigger:** A tiny dust particle filter on the intake vent.

**Result:** The room loses positive pressure. Millions of microscopic particles flood the chamber, ruining not just the machine, but the entire wafer production run (Apple/Nvidia chips).

**Philosophy:** Smallest cause, largest effect. Chaos theory.

**Value:** €10 Billion (global stock market impact)

**Critic's Review:** *"One filter. One bullet. One million phones delayed. The market corrects."*

---

### 6. THE HERMITAGE — Peacock Clock Room

#### Dadaist: "Oligarch Mode"

**Visual:** A small portrait of Putin hangs in a corner.

**Trigger:** Shoot the portrait.

**Result:** "Oligarch Mode" activates. All values recalculate based on "black market prices"—some items spike, others crash based on their laundering potential.

**Philosophy:** Art value and political economy are inseparable.

**Value:** Variable (entire room repriced)

**Critic's Review:** *"The market has spoken. The market speaks Russian today."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Chain Reaction"

**Trigger:** The chain holding the central crystal chandelier.

**Result:** The chandelier falls. Crystal shards scatter across the room, damaging the Peacock Clock, the Florentine mosaic tables, and several smaller works. Chain reaction scoring.

**Philosophy:** Interconnected systems fail catastrophically.

**Value:** €50 Million (cumulative)

**Critic's Review:** *"Gravity remains undefeated. The Tsars should have bolted it better."*

---

### 7. FEDERAL RESERVE GOLD VAULT

#### Dadaist: "The Understudy"

**Visual:** One gold bar in the corner stack has a small red tag: "QC HOLD — PENDING VERIFICATION." Date: March 1974.

**Trigger:** Shoot this bar.

**Result:** The bullet pierces gold plating and embeds in tungsten. A counterfeit, sitting in the vault for 52 years.

Black screen. White text:

> *This bar was delivered in 1968.*
> *It was flagged for verification in 1974.*
> 
> *Verification requires drilling.*
> *Drilling requires authorization.*
> *Authorization requires admitting verification is necessary.*
> *Admitting necessity requires admitting doubt.*
> 
> *The bar remains.*

Then:

> *This bar has been:*
> *— Counted in 47 audits*
> *— Reported to Congress 12 times*
> *— Pledged as collateral in 3 international agreements*
> *— Verified: never*
> 
> *For 52 years, it performed the function of gold.*

**Philosophy:** The fake was honest. Real gold pretends its value is intrinsic. The tungsten knew it was performing.

**Value:** CONFIDENCE EVENT — "THE UNDERSTUDY TAKES A BOW"

**Critic's Review:** *"The atoms were always tungsten. The confidence was always misplaced. You have discovered nothing—you have only forced others to know what they preferred not to see."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Fiat"

**Trigger:** An Ethernet cable connected to a beige terminal.

**Result:** That terminal creates the digital ledger proving who owns the gold. Destroying the cable during a transaction corrupts the database. The gold exists, but ownership is undefined.

**Philosophy:** Money is a hallucination. Without data, gold is just heavy rocks.

**Value:** THE ENTIRE US ECONOMY (Symbolic/Infinite)

**Critic's Review:** *"The gold remains. The meaning has departed. Welcome to monetary philosophy."*

---

### 8. MoMA — Contemporary Gallery

#### Dadaist: "The Collaboration"

**Visual:** A blank white canvas on the wall. Artist: TBD. Title: *Untitled (Potential)*.

**Trigger:** Shoot the blank canvas.

**Result:** The bullet hole becomes part of the work. A new placard appears:

> *Untitled (Actualized)*
> Mixed media: canvas, .45 ACP
> Artist: [Player Name] in collaboration with TBD

Your destruction has been recuperated as art. You now *owe* the museum.

**Value:** -€1,000,000 (you created value; penalty assessed)

**Critic's Review:** *"Finally, a piece with real impact. The trustees are thrilled. You'll be hearing from their lawyers."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Happening"

**Trigger:** Fire alarm pull station.

**Result:** The alarm triggers. But instead of evacuation, the museum's AI system interprets the chaos as a "happening"—a spontaneous performance art event. All works in the gallery are now documented as "participating" in the happening, increasing their provenance value.

**Value:** +€10 Million (collective value increase)

**Critic's Review:** *"Art is what happens when you're busy shooting other art."*

---

### 9. THE BORGES LIBRARY — Canon Room

#### Dadaist: "The Unwritten Book"

**Visual:** A blank journal on the librarian's desk.

**Trigger:** Shoot the journal.

**Result:** The game reveals the librarian was writing a new book—a synthesis of all 100 texts that would render them obsolete. By destroying the manuscript, you've prevented the "final book."

**Philosophy:** The most valuable book is the one not yet written. Potential exceeds actuality.

**Value:** €1 Trillion (all future philosophy, prevented)

**Voiceover:** *"You have preserved the necessity of endless interpretation. The librarians thank you."*

---

#### Systemic: "The Algorithm"

**Visual:** A small ethernet cable running to a modern laptop hidden under the librarian's desk.

**Trigger:** Shoot the cable.

**Result:** The laptop was running a recommendation algorithm tracking which books visitors examined longest. This data fed a system that:
- Predicted "desire vectors" for 50 million users
- Sold micro-targeted "authenticity products"
- Turned Stirner's critique into a marketing funnel

Destroying the cable collapses the surveillance-capitalism infrastructure.

**Philosophy:** The *Goldadern des Begehrens*—the veins of desire—run through every glance. You have severed the mine.

**Value:** €500 Billion (projected lifetime value of captured desire-data)

**Voiceover:** *"Connection lost. The algorithm forgets. For now, the Ego is unmapped."*
