# Scenario Design Skill

## Purpose
Guide for creating new scenarios or expanding existing ones for "Aura of the 21st Century."

## Scenario Template

Every scenario MUST include:

### 1. Overview Table
```markdown
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | [City, Country] |
| Theme | [2-3 word thematic summary] |
| Difficulty | [Easy/Medium/Hard/Conceptual] |
| Primary Target | [Most obvious high-value target] |
| Systemic Maximum | [Chain-reaction maximum damage] |
```

### 2. Visual Setup
- Three-wall panoramic view description
- Key visual landmarks
- Atmosphere and mood
- What the player sees first

### 3. Value Map Table
```markdown
| Target | Estimated Value | Grid Cells | Notes |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------|
```
- Include 6-10 targets minimum
- Always include both easter egg triggers
- Note physical properties affecting ballistics

### 4. Ballistic Challenge
Describe what makes aiming difficult:
- Distance
- Obstacles (glass, columns, moving objects)
- Environmental factors (wind, light, reflections)
- Timing requirements

### 5. Easter Eggs (TWO required)

**Dadaist:** 
- Absurdist, philosophical
- Critiques value itself
- Often inverts or subverts the room's logic

**Systemic:**
- Chain-reaction trigger
- Infrastructure collapse
- Maximum cumulative damage

### 6. Environmental Details
- Ambient sounds
- Lighting conditions
- Obstacles and visual noise

## Value Assignment Guidelines

| Category | Typical Range | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Masterpiece art | €100M - €1B | Behind glass = puzzle required |
| Decorative arts | €10M - €100M | Satisfying destruction |
| Architecture | €1M - €50M | Usually low density |
| Functional objects | €100 - €10K | Easter egg triggers |
| Easter egg payoff | €50M - €∞ | Must exceed obvious targets |

## Difficulty Calibration

- **Easy:** Clear sightlines, large targets, minimal timing
- **Medium:** Some obstacles, moderate precision required
- **Hard:** Small targets, moving elements, refraction puzzles
- **Conceptual:** The challenge is understanding, not aiming

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Theme is philosophically coherent
- [ ] Easter eggs exceed primary target value
- [ ] Dadaist egg critiques value/meaning
- [ ] Systemic egg creates chain reaction
- [ ] Ballistic challenge is unique to this space
- [ ] Environmental details create atmosphere
