# Scenario 6: THE HERMITAGE — Peacock Clock Room

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | St. Petersburg, Russia |
| Theme | Mechanical complexity, political economy |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Primary Target | Peacock Clock (€30M) |
| Systemic Maximum | €50M (chandelier chain reaction) |

## Value Map

| Target | Estimated Value | Grid Cells | Notes |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Peacock Clock | €30M | 150 cells | Mechanical—hitting key gears multiplies damage |
| Crystal chandeliers (×4) | €5M each | 50 cells each | Shatter physics—spectacular |
| Florentine mosaic tables | €15M each | 80 cells | Stone inlay |
| Gilded columns | €2M each | Low | Cosmetic damage only |
| Parquet floors | €500K/m² | Low | Negligible |
| Putin portrait | €100 | 1 cell | Dadaist trigger (corner) |
| Chandelier chain | €50 | 1 cell | Systemic trigger |

## Ballistic Challenge

- **Visual confusion:** Reflective surfaces, crystal glints mislead aim
- **Combo potential:** Chandelier shatter creates glass rain, damaging items below
- **Clock mechanics:** Hitting specific gears causes cascade failures, multiplying damage

---

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "Oligarch Mode"

- **Trigger:** Small Putin portrait in corner
- **Effect:** Oligarch Mode — all values recalculate to black market prices
- **Philosophy:** Art value and political economy are inseparable

### Systemic: "The Chain Reaction"

- **Trigger:** Chandelier chain
- **Effect:** Chandelier falls, crystal shards damage clock, tables, surrounding works
- **Value:** €50 Million cumulative
- **Philosophy:** Interconnected systems fail catastrophically

## Environmental Details

- Ambient: Clock ticking, tourist whispers, footsteps on parquet
- Lighting: Natural from windows, crystal refraction rainbows
- Obstacles: Reflective surfaces, rope barriers, glass cases
