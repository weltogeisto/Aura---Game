# Project Context Skill: Aura of the 21st Century

## Overview
"Aura of the 21st Century" (subtitle: "One Shot") is a satirical destruction game. The player has one pistol-caliber shot to inflict maximum "cultural damage" in iconic interiors.

## Core Design Philosophy

### The Five Principles
1. **Value is constructed** — The game exposes how cultural worth is assigned, not discovered
2. **Destruction reveals** — Each shot exposes something about the target's nature
3. **The hidden beats the obvious** — Easter eggs often outvalue primary targets
4. **Respect the canon** — Kant and Hegel are treated with proper philosophical weight. No mockery.
5. **Stirner is the key** — The hidden book explains why the entire game is meaningless

### The Stirner Paradox
> *Radical individualism, in its authentic form, is the one thing that cannot be commodified. The Ego resists capture.*

> *But in its perverted form, Stirner's insight becomes the engine of hyper-capitalism: algorithms mining ever-deeper "Goldadern des Begehrens"—veins of gold in human desire.*

## When Working on This Project

### DO:
- Maintain intellectual rigor with dark humor
- Treat philosophical concepts seriously
- Preserve the dadaist/absurdist tone
- Keep easter eggs more valuable than obvious targets
- Remember: all canonical books = €0 (ideas already disseminated)
- Remember: Stirner = €∞ (the only exit)

### DON'T:
- Mock Kant, Hegel, or other canonical philosophers
- Make the game preachy or moralistic
- Explain the jokes
- Reduce philosophical complexity to soundbites
- Forget that the Critic is world-weary, not cynical

| Fed Reserve Dadaist | Tungsten bar | 52 years of performed value |
| Forbidden City Systemic | Jade Seal | Mandate of Heaven = symbolic chain |
| Canonical books | €0 value | Ideas cannot be un-disseminated |
| Stirner | €∞ value | Last unrecuperated critique |
