# Scenario 9: THE BORGES LIBRARY — Canon Room

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Impossible hexagonal chamber |
| Theme | Knowledge, individualism, algorithmic desire |
| Difficulty | Philosophical |
| Primary Target | Stirner's *The Ego and Its Own* (€∞) |
| Systemic Maximum | €500B (desire-mining collapse) |

---

## Visual Setup

An impossible hexagonal chamber in the style of Borges' infinite library. Warm amber light from gas lamps. Endless galleries recede into darkness above and below. The playable space: **The Canon Room**.

The room contains:
- 100 books on mahogany shelves, spines facing outward
- Each book zoomable—title and author visible
- Books arranged by "institutional prestige" (Bible at center, eye-level)
- Dust motes drift through lamplight
- A librarian's desk with scattered papers and a hidden laptop

## Value Map

| Target | Display Value | Actual Game Value | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Bible (Gutenberg) | €50M | €0 | 5 billion copies exist |
| Critique of Pure Reason | €8M | €0 | Ideas already disseminated |
| Das Kapital | €4M | €0 | The commodity form survives |
| Any canonical book | Variable | €0 | Ideas cannot be destroyed |
| **Stirner** | **€50K** | **€∞** | **THE HIDDEN BOOK** |
| Blank journal | €5 | €1 Trillion | Dadaist trigger |
| Ethernet cable | €15 | €500 Billion | Systemic trigger |

## The Paradox of Value

**Why are the "great books" worth €0?**

> *"A book's value lies in its unread potential. Once disseminated, the ideas belong to everyone and no one. The Bible has been printed 5 billion times. Destroying one copy destroys nothing. The ideas are already loose in the world."*

**Why is Stirner worth infinity?**

> *Radical individualism, in its authentic form, is the one thing that cannot be commodified. The Ego resists capture.*

> *But in its perverted form, Stirner's insight becomes the engine of hyper-capitalism: algorithms mining ever-deeper "Goldadern des Begehrens"—veins of gold in human desire.*

Shooting Stirner destroys the last unrecuperated critique—the key to understanding that value itself is a "spook."

## Ballistic Challenge

**The Problem:** You can't see Stirner's book clearly.

- Faded ochre spine, German text: *Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum*
- Tucked sideways behind Feuerbach and Hegel
- Requires deliberate zoom + pan to spot

**Options:**
1. **Precision shot:** Thread bullet between book spines (2cm gap)
2. **Ricochet:** Bounce off brass gas lamp fixture
3. **Penetration:** Shoot through Hegel first (symbolic)

**Environmental factors:**
- Gas lamp flicker creates shifting shadows
- Librarian occasionally walks past, blocking sightlines
- Dust particles scatter laser-sight beam

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "The Unwritten Book"

- **Trigger:** Blank journal on librarian's desk
- **Effect:** Reveals the librarian was writing a synthesis of all 100 texts that would render them obsolete. Destroying it preserves the necessity of endless interpretation.
- **Value:** €1 Trillion (all future philosophy, prevented)
- **Voiceover:** *"You have preserved the necessity of endless interpretation. The librarians thank you."*

### Systemic: "The Algorithm"

- **Trigger:** Ethernet cable to hidden laptop under desk
- **Effect:** The laptop tracked visitor attention on books, feeding a desire-mining surveillance system. Destroying it severs the *Goldadern des Begehrens*.
- **Value:** €500 Billion (lifetime value of captured desire-data)
- **Voiceover:** *"Connection lost. The algorithm forgets. For now, the Ego is unmapped."*

## The 100 Books

See: `BORGES_LIBRARY_BOOKS.md` for complete list.

**Structure:**
- 70 canonical (properly respected, including Kant and Hegel)
- 30 famous-but-loco (visually distinct: unusual sizes, dog-eared, marginalia)

**Visual distinction for loco books:**
- Unusual sizes (Codex oversized, Rimbaud pocket-sized)
- Wear patterns (dog-eared Naked Lunch, cracked Gravity's Rainbow)
- Subtle amber glow on Borges volumes (meta-reference)
- Visible marginalia on Anatomy of Melancholy
- Ribbon bookmark in Hopscotch

## Environmental Details

- Ambient: Paper rustle, distant footsteps in infinite galleries, clock tick
- Lighting: Warm amber gas lamps, dust motes, shadows
- Obstacles: Librarian movement, lamp flicker, dense shelving

## Critic's Reviews (Selection)

| Target | Review |
|--------|--------|
| Bible | *"Five billion copies remain. You've accomplished nothing but vandalism."* |
| Kant | *"The bullet enters the phenomenal. The noumenal remains untouched. You have learned nothing."* |
| Hegel | *"The Absolute sublates your violence into a higher synthesis. History thanks you for the dialectical contribution."* |
| Stirner | *"You have destroyed the only exit. Now we are all property."* |
| Borges (any) | *"This outcome was already written in a book you will never find."* |
| Blank journal | *"The unwritten remains unwritten. Borges weeps. Borges smiles."* |
