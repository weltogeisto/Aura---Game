# Borges Library Skill

## The Canon Room: Special Rules

The Borges Library is the final scenario and operates under unique logic that subverts everything the player has learned.

## The Paradox of Books

### Why All Canonical Books = €0

> *"A book's value lies in its unread potential. Once disseminated, the ideas belong to everyone and no one. The Bible has been printed 5 billion times. Destroying one copy destroys nothing. The ideas are already loose in the world."*

This applies to:
- The Bible, Quran, and all religious texts
- Kant, Hegel, Plato, Aristotle
- Marx, Smith, Locke
- Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Homer
- ALL 100 books except Stirner

### Why Stirner = €∞

Max Stirner's *Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum* (The Ego and Its Own, 1844) represents:

1. **The last unrecuperated critique** — Every other philosophy has been commodified, branded, turned into a product category
2. **The key to understanding** — Stirner explains why "value" is a "spook" (a mental construct we mistake for reality)
3. **The only exit** — Destroying it traps everyone in the game of assigned values

**The Stirner Paradox:**
> Radical individualism cannot be commodified because packaging "authentic selfhood" makes it inauthentic. But perverted Stirnerism becomes hyper-capitalism: algorithms mining "Goldadern des Begehrens" (veins of desire).

## Book List Structure

### Tiers (70 Canonical)

| Tier | Location | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1: The Altar | Center, spotlit | Bible, Quran, Plato, Kant, Hegel |
| 2: Philosophy | Upper left | Western canon (Aristotle → Beauvoir) |
| 3: Political | Upper right | Machiavelli → Rawls |
| 4: Science | Lower left | Euclid → Hawking |
| 5: Classical Lit | Lower right | Homer → Goethe |
| 6: Modern Lit | Scattered | Austen → Morrison |
| 7: History/Non-Western | Mixed | Herodotus, Lao Tzu, Confucius |

### The Loco Shelf (30 Books)

Famous but strange. Visually distinct:
- Unusual sizes (Codex oversized, Rimbaud pocket-sized)
- Wear patterns (dog-eared, cracked spines)
- Amber glow on Borges volumes (meta-reference)
- Visible marginalia
- Ribbon bookmarks

**Loco categories:**
- Literary Madness (Tristram Shandy, Finnegans Wake, etc.)
- Philosophical Wildness (Zarathustra, Anti-Oedipus, etc.)
- Self-Aware Artifacts (Borges, Codex Seraphinianus)
- Scientific Strangeness (Lem, Zamyatin)

## Adding New Books

When expanding the library:

### For Canonical Books
- Must be genuinely influential
- Display value based on rarity/age
- Actual game value = €0
- Treat with respect (no mockery)

### For Loco Books
- Must be famous AND strange
- Include "Why It's Loco" explanation
- Visual distinction required
- Can be playfully described

### Never Add
- Living authors (too recent to judge)
- Controversial political figures (too charged)
- Self-help or business books (wrong register)
- Books chosen for shock value alone

## Stirner's Physical Location

```
Philosophy Shelf (Upper Left):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Kant                    │
│ Hegel ← Stirner tucked  │
│ Spinoza   behind here   │
│ Feuerbach               │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

- Faded ochre spine
- German text: *Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum*
- Requires zoom + pan to spot
- Tucked sideways, not spine-out

## Critic's Special Lines for Borges

The Critic has unique awareness in this scenario:

| Target | Review Style |
|--------|--------------|
| Any canonical book | Dismissive of destruction |
| Stirner | Recognition of catastrophe |
| Borges (any) | Meta-awareness of recursion |
| Blank journal | Paradox of the unwritten |
| Algorithm cable | Recognition of systemic critique |
