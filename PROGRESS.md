# Progress

## Milestone 3
- ✅ Added deterministic ballistics module with seed-driven sway and gravity drop integration.
- ✅ Added impact resolution pipeline with object metadata + UV extraction.
- ✅ Added value-mesh UV sampling with robust fallback behavior.
- ✅ Added scoring formula using mesh sample, zone multiplier, and critical modifier.
- ✅ Added deterministic + UV boundary tests.
- ✅ Added `docs/value-mesh.md` to lock down format, assumptions, equation, and determinism constraints.
