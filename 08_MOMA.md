# Scenario 8: MoMA — Contemporary Gallery

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | New York, USA |
| Theme | Modern art trap, creation through destruction |
| Difficulty | Conceptual (value is unstable) |
| Primary Target | Any painting (variable) |
| Systemic Maximum | +€10M (happening declaration) |

---

## Visual Setup

White cube gallery. Abstract paintings, minimalist sculptures, conceptual installations. One blank white canvas on the wall. Fire alarm pull station near exit. Everything is art. Maybe.

## Value Map

| Target | Estimated Value | Grid Cells | Notes |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Abstract painting | €5-50M | Variable | Depends on artist |
| Minimalist sculpture | €10-30M | Variable | Often hard to distinguish from furniture |
| Conceptual installation | €1-100M | Variable | May not be visible |
| Blank canvas | €500K | 50 cells | Dadaist trap |
| Fire alarm | €200 | 1 cell | Systemic trigger |
| Plinth (empty) | €0 or €5M | 10 cells | May be the artwork itself |
| Exit sign | €50 | 5 cells | Definitely not art. Probably. |

## Ballistic Challenge

The challenge is epistemological, not physical.

- **Identification:** What counts as art? What's furniture?
- **Value instability:** Modern art prices are speculative; value may spike or crash post-shot
- **The blank canvas trap:** Shooting it creates art, not destroys it

---

## Easter Eggs

### Dadaist: "The Collaboration"

- **Trigger:** Blank white canvas (*Untitled (Potential)*)
- **Effect:** Bullet hole becomes part of the work. New placard appears:

> *Untitled (Actualized)*
> *Mixed media: canvas, .45 ACP*
> *Artist: [Player Name] in collaboration with TBD*

- **Value:** -€1,000,000 (you created value; penalty assessed)
- **Philosophy:** Destruction is recuperated as creation. You owe the museum.

### Systemic: "The Happening"

- **Trigger:** Fire alarm pull station
- **Effect:** Alarm triggers. Museum AI interprets chaos as "happening" (spontaneous performance art). All works now documented as "participating," increasing provenance value.
- **Value:** +€10 Million (collective appreciation)
- **Philosophy:** Art is what happens when you're busy shooting other art

## Environmental Details

- Ambient: Climate control hum, echoing footsteps, pretentious murmurs
- Lighting: Perfect gallery white, track lighting
- Obstacles: Sculptures you might mistake for benches, installations on floor

## Design Notes

This scenario weaponizes contemporary art discourse against the player:

1. Shooting valuable art → expected destruction
2. Shooting the blank canvas → you become an artist (penalty)
3. Triggering the fire alarm → you increase value (inverse reward)

The only "winning" moves are the traps. Pure Dada.
